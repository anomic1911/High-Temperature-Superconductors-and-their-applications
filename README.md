## Description:

This term paper briefly reviews the history and developments of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). It was presentes as Term Paper for the PYL102 course, Indian Institute of Technology. We look at existing areas and domains where HTS have found applications or can find applications.

### Abstract 
High temperature superconductivity, discovered by Bednorz et al. (IBM,1986) remains an active area
of research worldwide, because of its high T c . The search for new superconductors has been sparked
off after this discovery. High Temperature Superconductors (referred to also as HTS or high-T c
superconductors) have found demonstrated application in a vast variety of applications due to its
high power density and high efficiency. In areas like power electronics, HTS has been already used
for prototypes of power cables, transformers, motors, and fault current limiters. HTS have found
profound applications in scientific magnets and filters and in NMR and MRI techniques. However
full-fledged commercialization of these applications is not yet observed. This paper briefly describes
High Temperature semiconductors, current developments on it and its major applications.
